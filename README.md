# libmysolvers
 This is Matthew Yang's Equation Solving Library, a set of solvers that use unconventional methods to solve equations, implemented in C, written by me. This library is a continuously developed library with no stable release. Additionally, there are some other libraries I have written that I develop here. You must download the latest version or clone it to update it.

# Additional libraries
- `libcharge` Electrical engineering solvers and functions

# Supported equation types
**Quadratic:**
- standard single quadratic equation

**Linear**
- standard two-equation set

**Other calculations**
- Triangle centroids
